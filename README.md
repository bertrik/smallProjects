# smallProjects
A collection of code for various small projects.

The projects are documented on  https://complexevo.org/

* GridBallanceLamp : https://complexevo.org/See%20the%20balance%20of%20the%20high-voltage%20grid!.html
  *   the arduino code  is upgraded to deal with SSL, since TenneT changed their site ecently. However,  the TenneT certificate does not suppot the same ciphers as the arduino library. Maybe the code is useful to you for a different site.
  * python code will be used to extact the data and post it to MQTT. The arduino code will be updated to work with MQTT.
